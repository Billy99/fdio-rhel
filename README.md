# Red Hat FD.io Documentation Repository

This is the official downstream repository for the Red Hat FD.io product documentation.
Currently, only VPP (Vector Packet Processing) is support, but other projects under FD.io may be supported in the future.

## Branches

### Production Branches (English)

Production branches map to published content for each version of Red Hat FD.io released.

*master*: The most recent documentation version. Currently VPP 18.04.

*vpp-18-04*: The VPP 18.04 documentation.

### Working Branches

Writers use topic branches to track work that has not yet been verified merged to a production branch.

Topic branches use the format 'BZ#_123456_' with an optional description appended. For example 'BZ#1322343_VPP_Install_Updates'.

Topic branches can be safely deleted when their content has been merged to a production branch.
